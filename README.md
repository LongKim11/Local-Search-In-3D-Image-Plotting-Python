# 🧭 Local Search in 3D Image Plotting – Python Project

This project visualizes local search algorithms over a 3D rendering of the Mona Lisa image. It demonstrates how different strategies like **Random Restart Hill Climbing**, **Simulated Annealing**, and **Local Beam Search** can find optimal paths toward global maxima in a complex search space.

> 🧠 The objective is to reach the highest peak (global maximum) using smart search paths that are also smooth and non-zigzagging.

## 🧪 Algorithms Implemented

- 🔁 **Random Restart Hill Climbing**
- ❄️ **Simulated Annealing**
- 🔦 **Local Beam Search**

Each algorithm is used to explore the 3D surface and identify the highest peak with path optimization.
